*********************************
PlasmaPy Documentation Guidelines
*********************************

This document describes the documentation requirements and guidelines
to be followed during the development of PlasmaPy and affiliated
packages.

Docstrings
==========

* All public classes, methods, and functions should have docstrings.

* PlasmaPy uses the `numpydoc
  <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`_
  standard for docstrings.

* Simple functions may need only a one-line docstring

Narrative Documentation
=======================

* Each subpackage must have narrative documentation describing its use.
